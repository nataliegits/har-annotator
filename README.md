# HAR annotator

A reproducible pipeline that filters **Human Accelerated Regions (HARs)** to
constrained, neurodevelopment-adjacent, disease-overlapping elements, assembles
a per-element evidence table, and ranks candidates with a **transparent
additive score**, then interprets the top neurodevelopmental candidates with
an antagonistic-pleiotropy framing.

Everything is hg38. Every data pull is cached, hashed, and logged to
`data/manifest.csv`, so the analysis replays end-to-end from source.

```
python run_pipeline.py            # reproduces the shipped shortlist exactly

## What This Pipeline Does

HARs are stretches of DNA that stayed nearly frozen across mammals for millions
of years, then changed suddenly in the human lineage. There are 3,257 of them,
and most have no known function. This pipeline asks a narrower question: *which
of these human-accelerated regions are the best candidates for shaping human
brain development?*

It works in five moves:

1. **Filter (Phase 1).** Start from all 3,257 HARs and keep only those that pass
   three tests in a row: evolutionarily constrained, sitting near a gene already
   known to cause a neurodevelopmental disorder, and overlapping a genetic signal
   for a brain-related trait. That drops 3,257 → **363**.
2. **Gather evidence (Phase 2).** For each of the 363 survivors, record *how
   strong* every line of evidence is: how conserved, which disease gene and how
   close, how significant the trait signal, whether it's active in fetal brain
   tissue, whether that gene is busiest during mid-fetal development, how much its
   sequence diverged from chimpanzee, and how many transcription-factor binding
   sites it disrupts.
3. **Score (Phase 3).** Collapse that evidence into one number per HAR, a
   transparent weighted sum, with every axis's contribution kept visible, and
   rank them best-to-worst.
4. **Interpret (Phase 4).** Read the top of the list and check that the ranking
   makes biological sense, gene by gene.
5. **Visualize & package (Phases 5–6).** Draw the figures and bundle everything
   into a rerunnable package.

**One honest precision.** This does *not* discover new disease genes. The disease
genes came *in* as a filter (step 1 requires proximity to a known
neurodevelopmental-disorder gene). What gets ranked is the **regulatory
regions**: the output is a shortlist of candidate HARs, i.e. hypotheses about
*which human-accelerated elements are worth studying* for a role in human brain
development during fetal gestation. The genes are the input; the HARs are the
result.

---

## What it does: the funnel

| Step | Filter | HARs |
|------|--------|------|
| 0 | All HARs (Cui et al. 2025, *Nature*, hg38) | 3,257 |
| A | Mammalian constraint, mean 241-way phyloP > 1.0 | 2,757 |
| B | Within 1 Mb of a neurodevelopmental-disorder gene TSS | 1,718 |
| C | Within 25 kb of a genome-wide-significant neuropsychiatric GWAS lead SNP | **363** |

The 363 candidates are then scored on seven axes and ranked. Top candidate:
**HAR_575 → *POC1B*** (PLAC-seq-linked, educational-attainment GWAS overlap,
embryonic-brain DNase-active). Classic neurodevelopmental / human-evolution
genes recovered in the shortlist include *ZEB2, TCF4, MEF2C, PHOX2B, TCF20,
ZSWIM6, FOXP2, SOX5, NR4A2, MITF*. The seventh axis, **temporal**, adds a
developmental clock: how concentrated each target gene's prenatal expression is
in the mid-fetal convergence window (~10–24 post-conception weeks, BrainSpan),
the developmental moment where human-specific regulation and neuropsychiatric
risk are thought to coincide. Of the 363 candidates, 347 target genes could be
timed and 129 peak inside the mid-fetal window.

---

## The transparent score

The total is a **weighted sum of seven normalized (0–1) component scores**, no
black box. Every `score_<c>` and its weighted `contrib_<c>` is retained as a
column, so `total_score` decomposes exactly (verified: max reconstruction
error 0.0).

```
total_score = Σ  WEIGHTS[c] · score_c        (c in the seven components below)
```

| Component | Default weight | Evidence |
|-----------|:-:|----------|
| `constraint`   | 0.18 | mean 241-way phyloP, min-max scaled |
| `gene`         | 0.22 | DDG2P confidence tier × TSS-distance decay, +0.15 if PLAC-seq-linked |
| `disease`      | 0.22 | −log10(GWAS p) × proximity to lead SNP |
| `brain`        | 0.13 | ENCODE embryonic-brain DNase peak overlap (+ PLAC-seq ATAC support), *where* |
| `temporal`     | 0.13 | fraction of target gene's prenatal expression in the mid-fetal window (BrainSpan), *when* |
| `acceleration` | 0.07 | real human–chimp substitution rate from the panTro5 ortholog alignment (subs / aligned bp), min-max scaled |
| `motif`        | 0.05 | JASPAR TF-motif sites gained + lost between the human and chimp alleles, min-max scaled |

Weights sum to 1.0 and are module constants (`har_annotator/score.py`),
overridable per run: `python run_pipeline.py --weights gene=0.35,disease=0.30`.
`brain` (*where* a target gene is active) and `temporal` (*when* it is active)
are the paired developmental-context axes.

### How we weighted the values and gave each a 0–1 score

Each axis goes through two steps: first the raw evidence is transformed into a
**normalized 0–1 score** (so a phyloP of 5.0 and a p-value of 1e-40 live on the
same scale), then that score is multiplied by a **weight** that says how much
the axis counts toward the total. Both numbers are kept as columns
(`score_<c>` and `contrib_<c>`), so nothing is hidden. Listed
heaviest-weighted first:

1. **gene, weight 0.22.** Score = `confidence × distance_decay + plac_boost`.
   The DDG2P tier becomes a number (definitive 1.0 → strong 0.75 → moderate 0.5
   → limited 0.3), multiplied by `1 − distance/1Mb` (a gene at the HAR ≈ 1, one
   at the 1 Mb edge ≈ 0), plus a flat **+0.15** if the gene came from a
   PLAC-seq physical contact rather than mere proximity. Clipped to [0,1]. Tied
   for the highest weight because gene-link quality is core to the hypothesis.
2. **disease, weight 0.22.** Score = `significance × proximity`. Significance
   is −log₁₀(p), capped at 50 then divided by 50 (p=5e-8 weak → p=1e-50 maxed);
   proximity is `1 − gwas_distance/25kb`. Multiplied, so a HAR needs **both** a
   strong signal **and** to sit close to the lead SNP. Tied at the top with
   gene, together they define the biological question.
3. **constraint, weight 0.18.** Score = min-max scaled `phylop_mean` across
   the 363 candidates (least-constrained → 0, most → 1). The evolutionary
   anchor, just below the two biological axes.
4. **brain "where", weight 0.13.** Score = `0.8 × dnase_overlap + 0.2 ×
   plac_atac`. Mostly the ENCODE embryonic-brain DNase overlap (0.8), topped up
   by PLAC-seq ATAC support (0.2); a HAR in fetal-brain open chromatin with
   neuronal ATAC support reaches 1.0. One of the paired developmental-context
   axes.
5. **temporal "when", weight 0.13.** Score = `gene_midfetal_frac`, the
   fraction of the target gene's prenatal expression falling inside the
   mid-fetal window (10–24 pcw), clipped to [0,1]; no BrainSpan trajectory → 0.
   Weighted equal to brain, its "where/when" partner.
6. **acceleration, weight 0.07.** Score = min-max scaled `subst_rate`, the
   **real** human–chimp substitution rate: we fetch each HAR's human (hg38) and
   chimpanzee (panTro5) orthologous sequence, align them, and count
   substitutions per aligned bp. This replaces the earlier HAR-width proxy
   (which, we verified, was uncorrelated with real divergence, Pearson r ≈
   −0.07). Weight stays low at 0.07 because divergence is not lineage-polarized
   (see caveat below), but it is now a genuine measurement, not a placeholder.
7. **motif, weight 0.05.** Score = min-max scaled `motif_disruption`, the
   number of JASPAR transcription-factor binding sites **gained or lost**
   between the human and chimp alleles (scan both sequences against 879
   JASPAR2024 CORE vertebrate motifs at a per-motif false-positive rate of
   1e-4; a site "present" in one allele but not the other counts as a
   disruption). This is the direct sequence-to-function signal, which TF
   binding sites the human-specific changes create or destroy. Previously
   hard-coded to 0; now live.

The seven weights sum to 1.0, so the **total_score** is itself a 0–1 number:
`Σ WEIGHTS[c] · score_c`. Every weighted piece (`contrib_c`) is retained, so
the total adds back up exactly (verified at 0.0 reconstruction error) and you
can see precisely how many points each axis gave each HAR. Two properties are
worth keeping in mind: the weights are hand-set priors, overridable with
`--weights`; and three axes (`constraint`, `acceleration`, and `motif`) are
scaled *relative to the candidate set* (min-max), while `gene`, `disease`,
`brain`, and `temporal` use fixed, absolute transforms that do not shift when
the funnel changes.

**Note on the temporal axis and reproducibility.** Adding `temporal` as a
seventh axis re-normalized the six original weights, so the default ranking now
incorporates the developmental clock and differs from the pre-temporal v1
shortlist (this is intended; it is the whole point of the axis). To reproduce
the exact pre-temporal v1 ranking, run with `--no-temporal`, which skips the
BrainSpan stage and restores the six-axis spine.

**Note on the real acceleration + motif axes.** The `acceleration` and `motif`
axes were upgraded from proxies (HAR width; motif = 0) to real measurements
(human–chimp substitution rate; JASPAR TF-site gains/losses). Weights were left
unchanged so the effect is attributable to the data, not a re-weighting: the
ranking is highly stable (Spearman ρ = 0.976 vs the proxy ranking), with the
top of the list reordering as genuinely high-divergence HARs surface (new #1
ZSWIM6/HAR_2378). To reproduce the pre-upgrade axes, run with `--no-seq-axes`.

**SFARI substitution note.** SFARI Gene was unreachable from the build

set is **DDG2P only**: the shipped 363 candidates reflect that. The pipeline
unions any SFARI symbols supplied via `--sfari`, so a SFARI export can be
dropped in without code changes (this will change the candidate count and
ranking).

**TF-motif note.** The `motif` score component (weight 0.05) is **live**. Both
the human (hg38) and chimp (panTro5) HAR alleles are scanned against the 879
JASPAR2024 CORE vertebrate PWMs (`pyjaspar`) at a per-motif false-positive rate
of 1e-4; a binding site present in one allele but not the other counts as a
gain or loss, and `motif_disruption` = gains + losses drives the axis
(min-max scaled). The recurrently gained/lost factors across candidates are
neurodevelopmental regulators (MEIS1/2, PBX3, PKNOX1, DLX1, POU/SOX2, MEF2A).
This is a candidate-level, presence/absence call, not an affinity model; see
caveat 4.

## What "mammalian constraint" means here

**phyloP** (phylogenetic P-value) is a per-base evolutionary-rate score. For
each position in the human genome, it compares the substitution rate observed
across an alignment of 241 placental mammals against the rate expected under
neutral drift. Positive = **slower than neutral** = the base has been conserved
= *constrained* (purifying selection removed mutations there). Negative = faster
than neutral (accelerated); ~0 = evolving neutrally. The scores come from the
Zoonomia Cactus 241-mammal alignment (Christmas et al. 2023). We take the
**mean phyloP over each HAR's span** as its constraint value and keep HARs with
mean > 1.0 (Step A: 3,257 → 2,757).

Why constraint matters for a *human-accelerated* region: the apparent paradox
is the point. A HAR is a locus that was **deeply conserved across mammals**
(high ancestral constraint) yet **changed rapidly on the human branch**. The
mammalian-constraint filter enriches for elements that were doing something
selectively important for a long time; the human-specific change is then more
likely to be functionally consequential than a change in a locus that was
never constrained. Constraint (mammalian, phyloP) and acceleration
(human-branch) are **different axes**: this pipeline scores constraint
directly (mammalian phyloP) and acceleration directly from the human–chimp
substitution rate, with the caveat that the latter is not lineage-polarized.

**"Sharpened disease mapping": what's actually established vs. what we
verified here.** The strong, external result is that base-pair mammalian
constraint from Zoonomia enriches for trait/disease heritability and improves
prioritization of causal variants, shown genome-wide in Sullivan et al. (2023,
*Science*, doi:10.1126/science.abn2937), not something this pipeline proves. To
avoid overclaiming, the enrichment was checked **inside this dataset**: of all
3,257 HARs, constrained ones (phyloP > 1) overlap a neuropsychiatric GWAS locus
(±25 kb) at **21.0%** vs **15.4%** for unconstrained, a **1.37× enrichment**
(Fisher odds 1.46, p = 3.6×10⁻³). So constraint does concentrate disease
overlap in our HAR set, but **modestly**; it is a sensible prioritization axis,
not a strong causal sieve on its own. The pipeline's power comes from
*combining* it with gene, disease, and brain-activity evidence.

## Interpretation & caveats

Read `top_candidates_interpretation.md` for the top-candidate biology. Three
caveats apply throughout and are load-bearing:

1. **Overlap ≠ causation.** "Overlaps a GWAS locus" means within 25 kb of a
   lead SNP, not that the HAR is the causal element or that its
   human-specific changes drive the association.
2. **Nearest gene ≠ target gene.** `nearest_tss` assignments are a proximity
   heuristic; `plac_linked` assignments rest on a neuronal PLAC-seq interaction (stronger,
   still correlative).
3. **Acceleration is real but not lineage-polarized.** Each HAR's human (hg38)
   and chimpanzee (panTro5) orthologous sequences are fetched from the UCSC
   sequence API (coordinates from Cui Supplemental Table 2), globally aligned,
   and the substitution rate (subs / aligned bp) drives the axis. This replaces
   the former HAR-width proxy. The remaining caveat: human–chimp divergence
   does not by itself prove the change occurred on the *human* branch rather
   than the chimp branch; strict human-specific acceleration needs an outgroup
   (e.g. macaque) or a branch model. It is a large improvement over width but a
   first-order measure; the axis weight (0.07) reflects that.
4. **Motif disruption is a model-based call.** The motif axis counts JASPAR
   TF-binding sites gained/lost between the alleles at a fixed false-positive
   threshold (1e-4). This flags *candidate* regulatory consequences; it does not
   quantify affinity change, and JASPAR PWMs are themselves models of binding
   preference. Treated as a low-weight (0.05) hypothesis-generating signal.

**Antagonistic pleiotropy.** HARs were deeply conserved across mammals, then
changed rapidly on the human lineage. When such an element sits in the
regulatory neighbourhood of a gene whose disruption causes a developmental
disorder *and* whose common variants associate with a psychiatric/cognitive
trait, the same regulatory tuning that may have been advantageous for human
brain evolution can raise disease liability under a different genetic
background, a hypothesis-generating pattern, not a mechanistic claim.
